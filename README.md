Roadmap.sh project: Single page CV

Project-URL: https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv

## URL for final project:
https://majzen11.github.io/single-page-cv/

## Key requirements for this project:

- Semantic HTML: Use appropriate HTML tags to structure your CV.
- SEO Meta Tags: Include essential meta tags for SEO.
- Open Graph (OG) Tags: Add OG tags for better social media sharing.
- Favicon: Add a favicon for your CV page.

The structure of your CV should be easily understandable and ready for styling in a future project.

## My thoughts on this project

I liked doing this porject just to get down to the very basics of html. I've done a few projects before that have included css, but I think it's good for med to get down to the very basics since I am still in the very early stages of learning.

I did choose to add a little bit of style to give the final product a cleaner look. This also matched the example image in the project detail. However, I only added this within the html, rather than make a separate stylesheet since it was not a lot of styles added.

## Challenges and things I learned
- Making Open Graph tags was completely new to me, so I hope I added the correct tags.
- This also goes for SEO meta tags. I have done that before, but not in such detail.
- I have never added a favicon before and I found a website that created the favicon for me. It also created code to add to my project. It worked fine when I looked at my project in the live server, however when I published the site to GitHub Pages is's not longer showing up and I don't know why.
